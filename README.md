Yet another <b>Arch-based</b> distribution. <b>tuxOS</b> has been customized to my preferences for a fast and effortless installation. This particular distribution includes both X11 with bspwm and Wayland with hyprland and wayfire. Furthermore, the distribution comes preinstalled with Nvidia drivers and all the additional tools and features that I frequently utilize in my daily routine.
